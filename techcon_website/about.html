      <section>
        <h3>The Origins and Evolution of TechCon</h3>
        <p>TechCon began in the early 2010s as a small gathering of tech enthusiasts. The first official event in 2012, known then as “Tech Pioneers United,” brought together developers and innovators to share ideas and build solutions. By 2015, it was rebranded as TechCon, expanding to cover topics like artificial intelligence, hardware integration, and ethical technology use.</p>
        <p>Over time, TechCon introduced startup pitch battles, interactive demo zones, and became a platform for underrepresented voices in tech. It went virtual during the pandemic and now embraces a hybrid format.</p>
